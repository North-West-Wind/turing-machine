# Archive/Logic

## Overview

In our project, C# is used as a temporary game development language. Since TS is needed to provide optimisation, the old C# code will be archived here.

## Structure

There are currently two directories inside this repository. One is the old implementation, which can only support one tape and one head, with limited testings.

The second one is the newer implementation, which could now 80% realise the specifications and designs in the previous documents (i.e. SRS2, SRS3). But testings are still limited, with 5 test cases (all passed) in a separate unit test project. It is expected to perform a more holistic testings after porting to TS.

For you convenience, you may visit the links below to run the project on local devices, I have uploaded the full project in my repository.

## Side Note

Feedbacks are welcomed to the implementation of C# logic! However, future development might not be conducted in C# (at least in this project!).
