# Structure
Since frontend and backend can be completely separated, simply put everything in separate directories.
- `frontend/`: Frontend code
- `backend/`: Backend code

For side-specific structures, they will be contained in their corresponding directories, and not here.

The `main` branch should be as simple as possible. So basically, do everything on a different branch, and then merge it back to `main`.  
This file is the only exception.
