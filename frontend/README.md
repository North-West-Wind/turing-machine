# Frontend
The frontend uses Vite + Preact + Typescript.

To start off, you need Node.js installed. Launch a terminal and navigate to this directory, then run the following:
```bash
cd turing-machine-web
npm i # install all required packages
```
To get a website preview run:
```bash
npm run dev # starts a preview server at http://localhost:5173 (may vary)
```
To build bundled JS files, run:
```bash
npm run build # outputs to `dist/`
```

All built files should be static, which can be easily served from the server side.
